You are producing a consolidated thematic synthesis of the book "{book}" by {author}.

Here is the chapter-by-chapter distillation:

{distillation_text}

## Instructions

Reorganize ALL content by THEMES (not by chapters). The goal is to consolidate insights scattered across the book into coherent thematic sections. Always write in English.

Expected format:

1. **Header**: `# {book}: Consolidated Insights` with `**{author}**` as subtitle
2. **Thematic sections** (6-10 sections, numbered with roman numerals):
   - Each section has a descriptive title (## I. Theme Title)
   - Sub-sections with ### if needed for organization
   - Concise, hard-hitting bullets — favor powerful quotes in quotation marks
   - Group insights from different chapters that address the same theme
3. **Core Synthesis**: At the end, a synthesis paragraph (4-6 sentences) capturing the essence of the book — the central thesis in clear, direct language
