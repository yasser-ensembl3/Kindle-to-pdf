2. **Deep Facts**: 3rd-5th layer insights beyond common knowledge
3. **Action Items**: Concrete steps from Maté's recommendations

---

## Chapter 1: ADD Epiphany

### Phenomenology
- The mind of ADD flits like "some deranged bird that can light here or there but is perched nowhere long enough to make a home"
- Terror of being alone with one's own mind—always needing a book in pocket as "emergency kit"
- Throwing scraps to the mind "as if to a ferocious and malevolent beast that would devour me the moment it was not chewing on something else"
- Sense of never approaching one's potential—"talents or insights he could perhaps connect with if the wires weren't crossed"
- Deep emotional hurt visible in "downcast, averted eyes, rapid discontinuous flow of speech, tense body postures, fidgety hands"

### Deep Facts
- ADD is not a medical disorder but a physiological consequence of life in a particular environment and culture
- The condition is not primarily genetic—it can be grown out of at any age
- DSM speaks "the language of signs because conventional medicine is unfamiliar with the language of the heart"
- Every aspect of ADD involves pain—this is the core that gets ignored in clinical definitions
- Medications cannot offer more than a partial, stopgap response

### Action Items
- [ ] Discard the illness model entirely
- [ ] Recognize that healing means "becoming whole"—not recovery from illness
- [ ] Stop expecting medications to be the answer
- [ ] Pursue patient, compassionate inquiry into deeper meanings

---

## Chapter 2: ADD Characteristics

### Phenomenology
- "Tuning out" as automatic unwilled response—you "find you heard nothing of what you've been listening to"
- Feeling like "a human giraffe...head floating in a different world, way above my body"
- Law of entropy: "order is fleeting, chaos is absolute"
- Driven restlessness: "I always think I should be doing something, but I don't know what it is" (said by Maté's 8-year-old son)
- Intense, almost palpable energy that makes others withdraw instinctively
- Sense of "somehow never approaching my potential"

### Deep Facts
- Hyperfocusing also denotes poor attention regulation—it's the opposite extreme of tuning out
- Passive attention (TV, video games) is automatic; active attention requires brain work the ADD brain lacks for low-interest tasks
- ADD is situational: the same child may perform well in one class, poorly in another
- The behaviors are not consciously chosen—neurophysiological forces do the actual deciding
- "ADD is a diagnosis not of category but of dimension"—it's a concentration of distributed traits

### Action Items
- [ ] Stop expecting willpower to overcome tuning out
- [ ] Recognize that "paying attention" is not something owed to adults
- [ ] Understand that hyperfocus and distractibility are two sides of the same coin
- [ ] Accept that ADD exists on a continuum—not binary

---

## Chapter 3: Controversy & Understanding

### Phenomenology
- The desire to be like everyone else, to stop being "different"
- Confusion about whether behaviors are chosen or forced
- Shame at being unable to do what others seem to do easily

### Deep Facts
- ADD is found in higher proportions in North America—not because of genes but because of society
- Many prison inhabitants have ADD or other preventable self-regulation disorders
- There is a hereditary contribution (sensitivity) but no genetic predetermination
- The actual outcome depends on circumstances—predisposition ≠ predetermination
- "Few diseases are purely genetic"—even Huntington's has environmental factors

### Action Items
- [ ] Accept responsibility for actions while understanding their origins
- [ ] Don't use ADD as excuse, but use understanding as map
- [ ] Recognize that genetic explanations can be psychologically soothing but often misleading

---

## Chapter 4: A Family Constellation

### Phenomenology
- The inability to be present—"even when physically at home"
- Weekend despair: "enveloped in enervated lethargy...neither active nor able to rest"
- Hyperactive environment creates hyperactive children
- Children experience parent's absence as proof they are "not worthy of the parent's attention"

### Deep Facts
- Environment does not cause ADD any more than genes do—but both are necessary
- Unresolved parental grief and tension directly shapes infant brain development
- The invisible environment (emotional atmosphere) is far more important than parenting techniques
- Parental workaholism = inability to say no = feeling duty toward world but neglecting indispensable people at home
- Depression in mothers, emotional conflict between parents—these shape ADD

### Action Items
- [ ] Examine your own workaholism and inability to say no
- [ ] Recognize that your stress directly impacts your child's brain development
- [ ] Understand that good times don't cancel out the effects of bad times
- [ ] Work on your marriage/relationship as ADD intervention

---

## Chapter 5: Time Blindness & Self-Regulation

### Phenomenology
- Only two time units exist: "now" and "not-now" (infinity)
- The magical thinking: "if I will it, it will happen"
- Feeling like a child inside an adult body
- Rage at being unable to control one's own actions

### Deep Facts
- ADD is underdevelopment of brain circuits, not illness
- Self-regulation develops in childhood through specific conditions—without them, it doesn't develop
- The prefrontal cortex (behind forehead) inhibits and regulates; in ADD it's underactive
- Stimulant medications work by "waking up the cop"—arousing cortical inhibition
- Brain plasticity means development can occur at any age

### Action Items
- [ ] Ask not "why does this disorder develop" but "what conditions prevent full development"
- [ ] Focus on creating conditions for development, not fixing a disorder
- [ ] Recognize that self-regulation can still develop in adulthood

---

## Chapter 6: Heredity & Environment

### Phenomenology
- The sense that "something is wrong with me" from earliest memory
- Different siblings in the same family can have completely different experiences

### Deep Facts
- Adoption studies are flawed—adoption itself is a trauma affecting brain development
- Stress hormones during pregnancy affect infant brain development
- Birth order, parental economic situation, historical circumstances all matter
- The "invisible environment"—parents' emotional states—is what shapes development most
- No two children have exactly the same parents because parenting varies between children

### Action Items
- [ ] Stop looking for genetic explanations
- [ ] Examine the emotional atmosphere your children experienced in infancy
- [ ] Recognize that siblings don't share the same environment

---

## Chapter 7: Environment's Impact

### Phenomenology
- The intuitive sense that one was born into the wrong circumstances
- Awareness that things could have been different

### Deep Facts
- Environment shapes genetic potential far more than commonly recognized
- Even in genetically identical twins, brain wiring and synaptic patterns differ
- The rate of adoption among ADD patients is 8-16 times the population rate
- The same pattern of reactivity can become talents OR problems depending on nurturing
- "Whether these features become talents or problems depends on how the child's nature is nurtured"

### Action Items
- [ ] If optimistic about environment, be optimistic about treatment
- [ ] Environmental approaches can resolve what environmental causes created

---

## Chapter 8: Brain Development

### Phenomenology
- The feeling that one's brain works differently from others'
- The sense of being "miswired"

### Deep Facts
- The brain has 50-100 billion neurons; genetic code cannot predetermine all connections
- 5/6 of brain branching occurs AFTER birth
- Human brain at birth is less mature than any other mammal's
- Neural Darwinism: circuits compete for survival based on use
- First nine months after birth = "second part of gestation"—the "exterogestation"

### Action Items
- [ ] Understand that brain development depends on emotional security and warmth
- [ ] Recognize breast-feeding as transitional stage from physical to emotional attachment
- [ ] Create calm, consistent emotional milieu for optimal brain development

---

## Chapter 9: Attunement

### Phenomenology
- The infant's experience of mother's gaze as either inviting or forbidding
- The sense of "no one understands" that persists into adulthood
- Feeling emotionally alone even in company

### Deep Facts
- Mother's right hemisphere programs infant's right hemisphere through unconscious emotional communication
- At 2-7 weeks, infants orient to mother's face; by 17 weeks, they follow mother's eyes
- "Double TV experiment": infants become distressed seeing mother's happy face on replay because it's not attuned to THIS moment
- Attunement cannot be faked—infants intuit the difference between real and staged emotions
- "It is easier to fool an adult with forced emotion than a baby"

### Action Items
- [ ] Understand that love felt is not the same as love experienced
- [ ] Recognize that stressed parents cannot provide adequate attunement
- [ ] ADD may equal "Attunement Deficit Disorder"

---

## Chapter 10: The Orbitofrontal Cortex

### Phenomenology
- The experience of irrational rage triggered by minor events
- The sense of being controlled by emotions rather than controlling them

### Deep Facts
- Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) controls attention, impulse inhibition, emotional regulation
- OFC imprints earliest interactions—"footprints of infancy" that guide all later relationships
- "Neurons that fire together wire together"—early emotional patterns become hardwired
- Brain chemistry is as much effect as cause—emotions affect neurotransmitter levels
- Infant monkeys separated from mothers show drop in dopamine levels after just 6 days

### Action Items
- [ ] Recognize that current emotional reactions often tell stories from infancy
- [ ] Understand that brain chemistry can be improved through experience, not just medication
- [ ] "Dopamine-rich nerve terminals and receptors are stimulated by joy"

---

## Chapter 11: Maté's Personal History

### Phenomenology
- The four-month-old photograph showing "dark, intense face with a look that belongs to one much older"
- Infant absorbing parents' terror without understanding why
- Mother's breast milk drying up from stress
- The three-week separation from mother: upon reunion, infant "responded as if she were an utter stranger"

### Deep Facts
- All Jewish infants in Budapest were crying after Nazi occupation—absorbing parents' anxiety
- Emotional stress transmitted to infant through physical handling, tone of voice, body language
- Diary entries avoided for 50+ years because they triggered implicit emotional memories
- One doesn't need war or genocide for parents to be stressed and for children to be affected

### Action Items
- [ ] Trace your own ADD traits to formative period experiences
- [ ] Recognize that love alone wasn't enough—the emotional context mattered
- [ ] Understand your own parents' circumstances during your infancy

---

## Chapter 12: Multigenerational Patterns

### Phenomenology
- The feeling that parents are distracted, preoccupied, not fully present
- The sense of walking on eggshells around a parent
- Carrying emotional burdens that feel ancient, inherited

### Deep Facts
- Parents of ADD children report fewer contacts with extended families and find them less helpful
- ADD children are less likely to have supportive grandparents
- "The generations are boxes within boxes"—suffering passes down through generations
- Many ADD adults minimize childhood trauma: "nothing too severe" while describing being whipped
- 14-25% of ADD children experienced parental alcoholism
- 30% of ADD children have parents with major depression

### Action Items
- [ ] Explore your parents' childhood to understand your own
- [ ] Don't blame—understand multigenerational patterns
- [ ] Recognize that your children absorb your unprocessed stress

---

## Chapter 13: Social Roots

### Phenomenology
- Living in a "frenetic culture" that normalizes ADD-like states
- The feeling that one cannot keep up with society's pace

### Deep Facts
- North America ha es more ADD than elsewhere because of social conditions, not genes
- Average work year is 158 hours longer than 1969—"an extra month tacked on"
- Sesame Street was designed for inner-city children with short attention spans—now all culture caters to this
- Day care cannot replace one-to-one attuned parenting

### Action Items
- [ ] Recognize that society creates ADD-like symptoms
- [ ] Advocate for parental leave and quality childcare
- [ ] Question whether your lifestyle serves your children's needs

---

## Chapter 14: Distractibility and Tuning Out

### Phenomenology
- The defensive "mental absence" that happens automatically
- The strange drowsiness that comes in emotionally charged situations
- The scatter-mindedness that feels like being "all over the place"

### Deep Facts
- Dissociation originates as defense against chronic emotional pain in infancy
- Tuning out requires two conditions: severe distress AND helplessness
- Once established, dissociation becomes the "default setting"—it no longer needs stimulus
- Attention first develops as an activity of emotion-processing brain areas
- "What looks like deficit of attention may be preoccupation with emotional anxieties"

### Action Items
- [ ] Stop demanding children "pay attention"—attention is a skill that develops
- [ ] Recognize that tuning out protected you once; now it's outdated
- [ ] Address emotional insecurity to improve attention

---

## Chapter 15: Hyperactivity, Lethargy, and Shame

### Phenomenology
- The "newsreel thinking"—rapid shifting of thoughts from one subject to another
- The constant internal discomfort at keeping still
- The shameful slump when criticized—body goes slack, eyes avert
- "I'm sorry" as the most common phrase in ADD vocabulary

### Deep Facts
- Hyperactivity = unregulated high arousal (sympathetic nervous system)
- Lethargy/shame = unregulated low arousal (parasympathetic nervous system)
- Both are normal toddler states that became stuck in ADD
- Hyperactivity is fed by "permanent, subterranean anxiety"
- Shame begins as normal physiological response to parental disapproval but escapes regulation

### Action Items
- [ ] Recognize hyperactivity as expression of anxiety, not character flaw
- [ ] Understand shame as physiological state, not moral judgment
- [ ] Don't interpret lethargy as laziness—it's shame

---

## Chapter 16: Unconditional Positive Regard

### Phenomenology
- The desperate desire to be loved without having to earn it
- Fear that love is conditional on performance

### Deep Facts
- Brain circuits remain responsive to environmental enrichment into advanced age
- Even rats deprived before birth showed brain improvements with enriched conditions
- "Under normal conditions 'growth' may be a characteristic of the brain throughout life"
- Neurological plasticity means development can occur at any age
- Carl Rogers: healing relies on basic trustworthiness of human nature

### Action Items
- [ ] Accept the child unconditionally—not for what they do but for who they are
- [ ] Prioritize long-term development over short-term behavioral goals
- [ ] Never use "time out"—it threatens the attachment relationship
- [ ] If you must pressure the child, acknowledge your own stake in it

---

## Chapter 17: Restoring Relationship

### Phenomenology
- The child's experience of being "cut off" when parent is angry
- The terror underlying defiant behavior

### Deep Facts
- Five principles for restoring parent-child attachment:
  1. Parent actively invites the child into relationship
  2. Parent does not judge the child
  3. Parent does not overpraise the child (praise can also be conditional)
  4. Parent does not parent from anger
  5. Parent takes responsibility for restoring relationship after conflict
- "Woo the child, as one would woo anyone with whom one wanted a relationship"
- Shame is weakened by not feeding it

### Action Items
- [ ] Invite the child—don't wait for them to come to you
- [ ] Bite your tongue rather than criticize
- [ ] When angry, "throw the clutch into neutral"
- [ ] After losing it, restore the bridge—don't make child work for forgiveness

---

## Chapter 18: Self-Regulation in Parents

### Phenomenology
- The parent's feeling of being controlled by the child's moods
- The invisible umbilical cord still connecting parent to child emotionally

### Deep Facts
- ADD child's moods only seem to control the family because parents lack emotional thermostat
- "If parents shift their focus off the child and become more responsible for their own actions, the child will automatically assume more responsibility"
- Parents' unresolved psychological conflicts are a major source of unrest for the ADD child
- "Children swim in their parents' unconscious like fish in the sea"
- Individuation (becoming a separate self) must be modeled by parents first

### Action Items
- [ ] Work on your OWN self-regulation, not just the child's behavior
- [ ] Recognize when your anxiety is driving the interaction
- [ ] "Children swim in their parents' unconscious"—keep the water clear
- [ ] Pursue your own psychological growth—your child's development depends on it

---

## Chapter 19: Myths About ADD Children

### Phenomenology
- The pain of being seen as "just looking for attention"
- The hurt of being told you're deliberately annoying adults

### Deep Facts
- Myth 1: "Just looking for attention"—Yes, because they have an attention DEFICIT
- The hunger is eased by giving attention when the child has NOT demanded it
- Myth 2: "Deliberately trying to annoy"—This ascribes adult cunning to childish inability
- "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few"
- Lifestyles must change: average parent spends only 5 minutes of meaningful contact per day

### Action Items
- [ ] Give attention BEFORE the child demands it
- [ ] Stop ascribing malevolent intentions to the child
- [ ] "Satiate the child with attention, stuff her full of it"
- [ ] Reconsider your lifestyle—ADD children need more parental availability

---

## Chapter 20: Counterwill

### Phenomenology
- The automatic "no" that arises whenever asked to do something
- The paradox of opposing even things you want to do

### Deep Facts
- Counterwill is natural instinct protecting the developing self
- It increases when attachment bond weakens, decreases when attachment improves
- Compliance achieved through fear is not good behavior—it's suppressed counterwill
- The most at-risk children are those whose counterwill falls completely silent
- Many "good little boys/girls" grow up to be depressed, troubled adults

### Action Items
- [ ] Keep attachment foremost to reduce counterwill
- [ ] Don't mistake acquiescence for genuine cooperation
- [ ] Make room for some resistance without threatening the relationship
- [ ] Engage only in fights you must win
- [ ] Encourage verbal expression of resistance

---

## Chapter 21: Motivation and Autonomy

### Phenomenology
- The absence of inner-directed purpose
- The inability to sustain interest in self-chosen projects
- Desperation for peer approval while defiant at home

### Deep Facts
- You cannot motivate a child—you can only foster intrinsic motivation
- Rewards and praise can be pressure tactics that increase counterwill
- Three necessary conditions: secure attachment, autonomy, structure with limits
- "Supporting autonomy is not the same as permissiveness"
- Language supports freedom, including freedom from one's own impulses

### Action Items
- [ ] Stop trying to motivate—create conditions for motivation to develop
- [ ] Support autonomy: give choices within reasonable limits
- [ ] Set limits without withdrawing warmth
- [ ] Help child put feelings into words (symbolization)
- [ ] "Will is like psychological muscle"—provide exercise through choices

---

## Chapter 22: ADD in the Classroom

### Phenomenology
- The public humiliation of being singled out for inattention
- The despair of not being able to do what seems easy for others

### Deep Facts
- Schools teach as if all brains work the same way—they don't
- "Who are we trying to teach must precede what are we trying to teach"
- Time-out from instruction should never be used as punishment
- The creative arts are essential for ADD children—cutting them first is backwards

### Action Items
- [ ] Teachers: "First, do no harm"—shaming reinforces negative self-image
- [ ] Schools need ADD specialists, not just medication pressure
- [ ] Keep attachment needs foremost in classroom too
- [ ] Allow more play and creative expression, not less

---

## Chapter 23: Examination Adjustments

### Phenomenology
- The blank mind under examination pressure
- The sense that tests measure anxiety, not knowledge

### Deep Facts
- ADD students may need different examination conditions (more time, quiet space)
- Homework completion shouldn't become a parent-school power struggle
- Structure must involve whole family, not just be imposed on the child
- Trust the child's nature to unfold—nature has a positive agenda

- [ ] Create family structure that supports the child's learning
- [ ] Trust that the child wants to succeed

---

## Chapter 24: Lazy Myth

### Phenomenology
- The "laziness" that is really emotional exhaustion
- Feeling too tired to do what you're supposed to do

### Deep Facts
- "Lazy" is a judgment, not an explanation
- The so-called lazy person will be a whirlwind of energy for interesting tasks
- "I always have to do everything" = "I've had to work too hard on relationship with you"
- When relationship improves, cooperation spontaneously follows

### Action Items
- [ ] Stop labeling as lazy—ask what the behavior communicates
- [ ] Reconnect emotionally before expecting cooperation
- [ ] Decode the child's messages with compassionate curiosity

---

## Chapter 25: Self-Esteem

### Phenomenology
- The deep conviction "I have not achieved enough in life"
- Dismissing one's own talents because "they came too easily"
- Craving good opinion of others while rejecting oneself

### Deep Facts
- Low self-esteem is not caused by poor achievement; it predates all memories
- Contingent self-esteem (based on achievement) is not true self-esteem
- True self-esteem says "I am worthy whether or not I can do such and such"
- "ADD adults don't have low self-esteem because they are poor achievers—it's due to low self-esteem that they judge achievements harshly"
- True self-esteem requires early experience of unconditional positive regard

### Action Items
- [ ] Recognize self-judgment as symptom, not accurate assessment
- [ ] Stop trying to achieve your way to self-worth
- [ ] Honor your genuine talents, even if they come easily
- [ ] Understand that your first "failure" was not your failure

---

## Chapter 26: Implicit Memory

### Phenomenology
- The overwhelming rage or helpless shame triggered by minor events
- The "examination amnesia" where studied material becomes inaccessible
- The hypersensitivity to any sign of withdrawal or disapproval

### Deep Facts
- Implicit memory = emotional content of experiences encoded without conscious awareness
- "We may believe we are just reacting to something in the present, remaining completely in the dark about what the rush of feelings really represents"
- The "problem with authority figures" is implicit memory of early adult relationships
- Implicit fear memory can override explicit memory (studied knowledge) under stress
- "For the rest of our lives, the seemingly trivial gestures first understood in late infancy serve to anchor both our human relationships and our thought processes"

### Action Items
- [ ] Recognize that intense reactions to minor events are memory, not present reality
- [ ] Don't fight implicit memory with logic—it doesn't work that way
- [ ] Create new experiences to build new neural pathways

---

## Chapter 27: ADD Relationships

### Phenomenology
- Wanting someone desperately when they're cold, then finding faults when they warm up
- The terror of being left, even just on the phone
- The boredom that sets in when the relationship becomes secure
- Feeling like "giving up the self" or "giving up the relationship" are the only options

### Deep Facts
- Fear of intimacy and dread of rejection coexist—both are implicit memories
- "Trevor's anxiety is not over ending relationships—he is serially ending relationships—but over being the one who is left"
- The boredom in relationships is really boredom with oneself
- "People gravitate toward their emotional mirror images"—partners match in psychological development
- Sexual avoidance often signals mutual emotional shutdown

### Action Items
- [ ] Recognize relationship patterns as implicit memory, not character
- [ ] Stop expecting partners to fill your inner emptiness
- [ ] Work on individuation—being yourself while in relationship
- [ ] Address your own "unfinished business" rather than focusing on partner's flaws

---

## Chapter 28: Self-Parenting I

### Phenomenology
- The sense of not knowing who you really are
- The lifelong habit of ignoring your own needs

### Deep Facts
- The adult must offer themselves the nurturing attention that ADD prevented
- Five qualities for self-healing:
  1. Compassionate curiosity in search for self-insight
  2. Self-acceptance: tolerating guilt and anxiety
  3. Not punishing yourself for where you find yourself
  4. Choosing a guide: psychotherapy and counseling
  5. Trusting gut instincts about therapists
- "I would very much like to understand why I feel so much anxiety" is a fruitful inquiry
- "We can let go of what we understand; we cling most ferociously to aspects that remain hidden"

### Action Items
- [ ] Practice compassionate curiosity toward yourself
- [ ] Stop saying "I should know better"—ask "I'd like to understand why..."
- [ ] Accept guilt as a guardian that served you once
- [ ] Find a therapist who provides unconditional positive regard
- [ ] Trust your gut feelings about whether therapy is helping

---

## Chapter 29: Self-Parenting II

### Phenomenology
- The dread of going to bed, of being alone with one's mind
- The feeling of being a "bad parent" to yourself

### Deep Facts
- ADD adults need to attend to: physical space, sleep, nutrition, exercise, nature, extracurricular limits, recreation, creative expression, meditation
- Night-owlism may be separation anxiety—dread of being alone with mind = implicit memory of infant's distress at being cut off from parent
- ADD traits are often "self-perpetuating"—creating the chaos that maintains them
- Meditation = direct way of weakening hold of ingrained neurological responses

### Action Items
- [ ] Clear physical space—clutter disorganizes the mind
- [ ] Establish sleep hygiene—brain regenerates during sleep
- [ ] Eat regular, nutritious meals
- [ ] Exercise vigorously daily; stretch
- [ ] Spend time in nature regularly
- [ ] Say no to extracurricular overload
- [ ] Distinguish entertainment from recreation
- [ ] Pursue creative expression

---

## Chapter 30: Addictions and ADD

### Phenomenology
- The addict's "vacant and driven look"
- The excitement being in the acquiring, not the having
- The ghostlike feeling of shrinking into self-contempt during a binge

### Deep Facts
- All addictions are anesthetics separating us from distress
- "The ADD person is also treating herself for a condition she is not even aware of having"
- Addiction makes the addict feel more connected to life while separating further from self
- "Feeding only appetite, not hunger"
- Social isolation and early deprivation cause permanent reduction in brain opiate receptors

### Action Items
- [ ] Accept the fact of addiction and take steps to end it
- [ ] Recognize that addiction blocks healing of ADD
- [ ] Understand that pain ownership is necessary—"There is no path toward oneself that leads away from the pain"
- [ ] Address the underlying causes, not just the addiction itself

---

## Chapter 31: Medications

### Phenomenology
- The miraculous clarity some experience: "I never saw the trees before"
- The unsettling feeling of "It's not the me I'm used to"
- The disappointment when medications don't fix life

### Deep Facts
- Medications work—but they should never be the only or even first treatment
- Only the person taking the medication has the right to decide
- Children should never be forced or tricked into taking medication
- Medications do not alter major life issues: low self-esteem, fear of intimacy, driven lifestyles
- "When children or adults stop taking them, they find that none of their problems have gone away"

### Action Items
- [ ] Never pressure children to take medication
- [ ] Use medications to help focus, not to change life
- [ ] Address depression or anxiety before or alongside ADD treatment
- [ ] Consider medications as last resort after other interventions
- [ ] Don't read more into medication effects than they merit

---

## Chapter 32: Embracing Struggle

### Phenomenology
- The lifelong feeling of "pretending to be normal"
- The soul-destroying fear of being different
- The tension of wearing a mask, fearing it will slip

### Deep Facts
- "The irony is that energy expended on attempts at sameness is wasted"
- "The world is much more ready to accept someone who is different and comfortable with it than someone desperately seeking to conform"
- "It's the self-rejection others react against, much more than the differentness"
- Healing is not an event but a process—"it is in the process itself"
- "The solution for the adult is not to 'fit in,' but to accept his inability to conform"

### Action Items
- [ ] Stop pretending to be normal
- [ ] Accept your inability to conform
- [ ] Join with others who share your experience
- [ ] Advocate for changes in how society views ADD
- [ ] Learn to endure pain when unavoidable rather than fleeing it
- [ ] "To love is to extend oneself"—and to attend means "to stretch toward"
- [ ] "If we can actively love, there will be no attention deficit and no disorder"
