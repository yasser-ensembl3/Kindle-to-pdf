When he finally sent the book to his publisher, Tolstoy wrote in his diary: \"I felt that I have been elevated to great spiritual and moral heights by communication with the best and wisest people whose books I read and whose thoughts I selected for my `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"1978\">`{=html}Circle of Reading`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"1995\">`{=html}.\" He would often return in his diary to meditate upon this book, repeating variants of \"What can be more precious than to communicate every day with the wisest men of the world?\" Tolstoy carefully selected the contributors to this volume, \"among the very best writers,\" as he repeated to his colleagues and friends. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"2312\">`{=html}They represented a wide variety of philosophical views, cultural backgrounds, and historical periods: \"It will be a big surprise to the readers,\" Tolstoy wrote, \"that together with Kant and other famous thinkers, they will find in my book thoughts by Lucy Malory, an unknown journalist from the United States, from Oregon.\" The first edition appeared in 1904 under the title `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"2687\">`{=html}Thoughts of Wise Men`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"2707\">`{=html}. It saw three editions during Tolstoy's lifetime, between 1904 and 1910, each published with a different subtitle: `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"2823\">`{=html}The Way of Life, Circle of Reading,`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"2858\">`{=html} and `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"2863\">`{=html}A Wise Thought for Every Day`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"2891\">`{=html}.`</st>`{=html}\n\n`<st c=\"2892\">`{=html} Between 1904 and 1907, Tolstoy worked on the enlarged and completely revised second edition, from which this, its first English translation, is drawn. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"3044\">`{=html}In mid-August 1905 he wrote the introduction that follows and noted in his diary: \"I have revised and enlarged my `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"3158\">`{=html}Calendar,`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"3167\">`{=html} now it is twice as big. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"3192\">`{=html}For two months I did not read`</st>`{=html}[]{#003.html_page_7}`<st c=\"3221\">`{=html} anything else, neither newspapers nor magazines, and I felt so good.... `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"3292\">`{=html}I became more and more astonished by the ignorance, and especially by the cultural, moral ignorance of our society.... `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"3409\">`{=html}All our education should be directed to the accumulation of the cultural heritage of our ancestors, the best thinkers of the world.\"`</st>`{=html}\n\n`<st c=\"3541\">`{=html} The major difference between the first edition (`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"3590\">`{=html} Thoughts of Wise Men`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"3611\">`{=html} ) and the second (`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"3630\">`{=html} A Calendar of Wisdom`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"3651\">`{=html} ) was that Tolstoy now grouped the thoughts according to topics for a certain day, week, and month. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"3752\">`{=html}He wrote on June 3, 1904, in his diary: \"I am busy with the `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"3812\">`{=html}Circle of Reading`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"3829\">`{=html}.... `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"3832\">`{=html}I cannot do anything else.... `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"3860\">`{=html}I have selected thoughts and grouped them into the following major topics: God, Intellect, Law, Love, Divine Nature of Mankind, Faith, Temptations, Word, Self-Sacrifice, Eternity, Good, Kindness, Unification of People (with God), Prayer, Freedom, Perfection, Work, etc.\" Tolstoy added about eight hundred of his own thoughts, written during his many years of meditation, or taken from previous diary entries. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"4269\">`{=html}He generally started each day with an opening thought of his own, added quotes by other sources, and finished each day with a closing thought of his own.`</st>`{=html}\n\n`<st c=\"4422\">`{=html} Additionally, he wrote a short story, or vignette, three to ten pages in length for the end of every week. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"4530\">`{=html}Each story corresponded to that week's moral, philosophical, or religious topic; he prepared fifty-two stories in all and called them `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"4664\">`{=html}The Sunday Reading Stories`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"4690\">`{=html}. The majority of these fifty-two stories were written by Tolstoy especially for this work; the rest were selected and adapted from writings by Plato, Buddha, Dostoevski, Pascal, Leskov, Chekhov, and others. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"4898\">`{=html}Tolstoy's prose style in these `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"4929\">`{=html}Sunday Reading Stories`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"4951\">`{=html} is very different from the sophistication of his earlier novels. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"5017\">`{=html}These stories, which were later greatly admired by Pasternak and Solzhenitsyn, were written in a clear, simple, almost primitive language,`</st>`{=html}[]{#003.html_page_8}`<st c=\"5155\">`{=html} designed, as they were, for a wide and general audience. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"5213\">`{=html}In them, Tolstoy combined simplicity of form and philosophical depth. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"5283\">`{=html}Because these stories did not appear in all editions, and because they are as a whole quite long, they do not appear in this edition.`</st>`{=html}\n\n`<st c=\"5416\">`{=html} On December 21, 1904, after reading the galley proofs of the second edition called `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"5500\">`{=html}The Calendar: The Circle of Reading for Every Day,`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"5550\">`{=html} Tolstoy wrote in his diary: \"During this last day I have descended from the spiritual and moral heights where I was all this time when I communicated with the best and wisest thinkers of the world when I created my `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"5766\">`{=html}Circle of Reading.\"`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"5785\">`{=html} This title was changed in the second revised edition, published in 1905-1907, to `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"5867\">`{=html}Wise Thoughts by Many Writers on Truth, Life, and Behavior Collected and Arranged for Every Day of the Year by Leo Tolstoy`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"5989\">`{=html}. From its first publication, the book was always present on Tolstoy's desk; it became his favorite book during the last five years of his life. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"6134\">`{=html}Every day, from 1905 to 1910, he read thoughts presented in the book for the corresponding day of the year, and he recommended the same habit to all his friends. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"6296\">`{=html}On May 16, 1908, he wrote to a man named Gusev: \"I cannot understand how some people can live without communicating with the wisest people who ever lived on Earth? `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"6460\">`{=html}... I feel very happy every day, because I read this book.\"`</st>`{=html}\n\n`<st c=\"6517\">`{=html} Tolstoy prepared a third revised, shortened, and simplified edition which appeared in print under the new title `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"6630\">`{=html}The Way of Life`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"6645\">`{=html} in 1910, the last year of his life. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"6682\">`{=html}He wished to make the book easily comprehensible for even the simplest and least educated people---peasants and children. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"6802\">`{=html}Most probably, Tolstoy compared `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"6834\">`{=html}A Calendar of Wisdom`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"6854\">`{=html} to `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"6858\">`{=html}War and Peace`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"6871\">`{=html} when he wrote that \"To create a book for the masses, for millions of people ... is incomparably more important and fruitful than to compose a novel of the kind which diverts some members of the wealthy classes for a short time, and then is forever forgotten. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"7129\">`{=html}The region of`</st>`{=html}[]{#003.html_page_9}`<st c=\"7142\">`{=html} this art of the simplest, most widely accessible

included the sources of his numerous quotes.`</st>`{=html}\n\n`<st c=\"7460\">`{=html} An edition of `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"7475\">`{=html}A Calendar of Wisdom`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"7495\">`{=html} was published in Russia in 1912, but after the Russian Revolution publication was forbidden under the Soviet regime, because of the book's spiritual orientation and its numerous religious quotes. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"7692\">`{=html}When it was again published in Russia, in 1995, after the recent democratic reforms, it enjoyed tremendous success, selling over 300,000 copies.`</st>`{=html}\n\n`<st c=\"7836\">`{=html} It has never before been translated into English. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"7887\">`{=html}The first English translation of `</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"7920\">`{=html}A Calendar of Wisdom`</st>`{=html}*`<st c=\"7940\">`{=html} will be a real discovery for the English-speaking reader. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"7999\">`{=html}Created by one of the world's greatest novelists and thinkers to represent the very best of the world's spiritual heritage, it draws on the greatest works of religion, philosophy, and literature the world has yet seen. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"8218\">`{=html}It belongs among the very best creations of human genius, a work which will serve its readers as a practical spiritual guide on how to live in peace with oneself and how to live a life filled with kindness, satisfaction, and happiness. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"8454\">`{=html}Tolstoy's original goal was the delivery of wisdom to the widest possible number of people, \"to entertain millions of readers.\" This aim remains as compelling now, in this time of increasing spiritual need, as it was then.`</st>`{=html}[]{#003.html_page_10}\n\n:::

BY LEO TOLSTOY`</st>`{=html}\n\n`<st c=\"49\">`{=html} I took the thoughts collected here from a very large number of works and collections. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"136\">`{=html}I indicated the author of each thought beneath it, though I did not mark the exact source or book title or work from which I took it. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"270\">`{=html}In some cases, I translated these thoughts not directly from their original sources, but from a translation from the languages in which they became known to me, so sometimes my translations might not be completely identical to the originals. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"512\">`{=html}When I translated thoughts by German, French, or Italian thinkers, I did not strictly follow the original, usually making it shorter and easier to understand, and omitting some words. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"696\">`{=html}Readers might tell me that a quote is not then Pascal or Rousseau, but my own work, but I think that there is nothing wrong in conveying their thoughts in a modified form. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"868\">`{=html}Therefore, if someone desires to translate this book into other languages, I would like to advise them not to look for the original quotes from the English poet Coleridge, say, or the German philosopher Kant, or the French writer Rousseau, but to translate directly from my writing. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"1151\">`{=html}Another reason some of these thoughts may not correspond to the originals is at times I took a thought from a lengthy and convoluted argument, and I had to change some words and phrases for`</st>`{=html}[]{#004.html_page_11}`<st c=\"1340\">`{=html} clarity and unity of expression. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"1374\">`{=html}In some cases I even express the thought entirely in my own words. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"1441\">`{=html}I did this because the purpose of my book is not to give exact, word-for-word translations of thoughts created by other authors, but to use the great and fruitful intellectual heritage created by different writers to present for a wide reading audience an easily accessible, everyday circle of reading which will arouse their best thoughts and feelings.`</st>`{=html}\n\n`<st c=\"1794\">`{=html} I hope that the readers of this book may experience the same benevolent and elevating feeling which I have experienced when I was working on its creation, and which I experience again and again, when I reread it every day, working on the enlargement and improvement of the previous edition.`</st>`{=html}\n\n`<st c=\"2085\">`{=html} ---LEO TOLSTOY, March 1908`</st>`{=html}\n\n`<st c=\"2110\">`{=html} Note to Reader: In all of the book's original Russian-language editions, Tolstoy highlighted on each page the one quote that most succinctly expressed the day's theme. `</st>`{=html}`<st c=\"2279\">`{=html}These quotes have been italicized in this edition.`</st>`{=html}\n\n`<st c=\"2329\">`{=html} ---PETER
