## Chapter 1

I appreciate the context, but I need to clarify: I don't have access to the previous conversation transcript that was compacted. The system shows a file path where that transcript exists, but I cannot read it directly since it's outside my current working scope.

However, based on the system reminder, I can see you're working on a project called "Kindle-to-md" in `/Users/mac/Yasser/Travail/Projets/claude-code-backup/Kindle-to-md/`.

Could you help me get oriented by briefly telling me:

1. **What was the last task** you were working on before the context compacted?
2. **What's the current state** of the project? (e.g., Are we parsing Kindle files? Converting to markdown? Analyzing content?)
3. **What should I focus on next?**

Alternatively, if you'd like me to continue with something specific you remember from before, just let me know what it was and I'll pick it up from there.
